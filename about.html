 <p>Although it seems like a normal game, Rainbow Six Siege was based on a book written by Tom Clancy, henceforth the full name of the game Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege.<br>
 Siege is an entry in the Rainbow Six series and the successor to Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots, a tactical shooter that had a larger focus on narrative.<br>
 </p>
 
 <p>After Patriots was eventually cancelled due to its technical shortcomings, Ubisoft wanted to remake the franchise<br>
 If you are not interested in the gaming aspect and want a better narrative here is the book version of Rainbow Six Siege <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5720.Rainbow_Six" target="_blank">R6 Book</a>
</p>

<p>
While R6 may just look like your average attack/defend game, most of the maps are based on true stories, <br>
</p>
Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege is partly based on real-life hostage events: <br>
The Lufthansa Flight 181 Hijacking (1977), The Iranian Embassy Siege (1980), the Moscow theater hostage crisis (2002), and the Waco siege (1993)</b>

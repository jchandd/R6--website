 Its not just the operators that are special, every map is uniquely different and diverse in gameplay ranging from the vast largeness<br>
  of The Lair to the close quarters fighting in Oregon each map will have a different play and combat style with some maps being easy to <br>
  traverse and attack to some being hard to attack and making you fight for every metre.Although combat is attack and defend, when on defenders<br>
  team you can choose which site to defend with each site having its pros and cons.<br>

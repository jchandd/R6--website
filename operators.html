<h1>Operators</h1>
Operators are the characters that you can choose<br>
to play as in R6(Rainbow Six Siege), each one is unique in its own way.<br>
Depending if your attacking or defending you will get a differnet set of <br>
operators in attackers from defenders, you also aren't allowed to have multiple 
of the same operators.

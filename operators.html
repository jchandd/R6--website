<h1>Operators</h1>
Operators are the characters that you can choose<br>
to play as in R6(Rainbow Six Siege), each one is unique in its own way.<br>
Depending if your attacking or defending you will get a differnet set of <br>
operators in attackers from defenders, you also aren't allowed to have multiple <br>
of the same operators.Although R6 isn't a story game and doesn't have a single-player <br>
 story mode when you go to the operators menu it will tell you what country they serve and <br>
 you can click on Bio to see a vast history of that operator. <br>

<p>In R6 there is a variety of different weapons each with different uses and customizations.Most weapons like Assault rifles are used for medium-range
and close-range combat.But weapons like shotguns have a special trait where they are able to break wooden walls and barricades beacause of their close range power.
Another unique thing in R6 is weapon customizations, this feature adds features to your weapon like different types of Muzzles,Grips,Understocks, and Sights.
When you add customizations they will give you perks like more zoom when aiming, less recoil,faster reload, and more.</p>
